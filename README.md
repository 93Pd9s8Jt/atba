## 🧭 Platform Snapshot

| Platform | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Android | ✅ Stable | Primary target; APK ships with each release |
| Android TV | ⚠️ Unstable | Partial support, but navigation is broken |
| Windows | ⚠️ Dev only | Run from source (`flutter run`). I test against this, so mostly functional except for deep linking |
| iOS | ❌ Untested | - |
| macOS | ❌ Untested | - |
| Linux | ❌ Untested | - |
| Web | ❌ Fails | Currently doesn't build due to drift dependency |

## Contributing
I'm always happy to review pull requests, and it would be particularly helpful if people could resolve issues on iOS and Android TV which I cannot debug. If you can't contribute code, suggestions and bug reports are also welcome.

## TODO/Upcoming features
- Fully functonal internal video player (probably media_kit)
- Fully cross platform 
- Responsive design
